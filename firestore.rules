/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Construction Material Order App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is designed for a front-end only application with temporary persistence, but prepares for future authentication and authorization.
 * Currently, all read access to the 'orders' collection is public, but write access is denied to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 * As authentication and user roles are implemented, the rules will evolve to enforce role-based access control.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The application stores all order documents in a single top-level collection: `/orders/{orderId}`.
 * Each document represents a material order with fields like applicantName, projectName, and delivery dates.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access to the `orders` collection is allowed to enable a user-friendly order management system.
 * - Write access to the `orders` collection is currently denied.
 * - Future authentication and authorization will restrict write access based on user roles.
 * - This setup simplifies the initial data model and facilitates temporary data persistence.

     * @allow (get, list) All users can read order documents.
     * @allow (create, update, delete) No one can create, update, or delete order documents.
     * @deny (create) Attempts to create a new order document will be rejected.
     * @principle Public read access with no write access for a simplified data model.

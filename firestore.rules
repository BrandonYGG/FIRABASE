/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data,
 * which is nested under the /users/{userId} path. This structure prevents unauthorized access
 * and ensures data privacy.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Each user document's ID must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/pedidos/{orderId}: Stores order information for a specific user. Each order is associated with the user via the userId path parameter.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user document.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete orders associated with their user ID.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Orders include a `userId` field that must match the `userId` in the path. This allows for efficient ownership checks without additional reads.

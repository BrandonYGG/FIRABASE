/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Firestore.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for both user profiles and orders.
 * Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data.  Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/pedidos/{orderId}: Stores orders placed by a specific user. Only the user who owns the parent /users/{userId} document can access these orders.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No public listing of users or orders is allowed.
 * - Data validation is limited to ensuring ownership and relational integrity (userId consistency).
 * - Denormalization:  The `userId` is present both in the path and in the Order document itself to guarantee authorization and data consistency.

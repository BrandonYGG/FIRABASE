/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and allows public read access to material orders.
 * @dataStructure
 *   - `/users/{userId}`: Stores individual user profiles.  Access is restricted to the user themselves.
 *   - `/orders/{orderId}`: Stores material orders placed by users. Orders are public and accessible to all users.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - Users can only read and write their own profile data under `/users/{userId}`.
 *   - Material orders in `/orders/{orderId}` are publicly readable but can't be created, updated, or deleted in this prototype.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *   -  No denormalization is used in this prototype.  Authorization is purely path-based, relying on `request.auth.uid` matching the `userId` path segment for user profiles.
 * @structuralSegregation
 *   - User profiles are stored in a private collection (`/users/{userId}`), while material orders are stored in a public collection (`/orders/{orderId}`).

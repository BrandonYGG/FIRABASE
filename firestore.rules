/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes strict authorization based on user identity and ownership,
 * while adopting a flexible approach to data validation to accelerate prototyping.
 * It enforces granular permissions for reads and writes at each collection path,
 * ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify data. Data validation
 * is intentionally relaxed to allow for rapid schema iteration and experimentation,
 * focusing on authorization checks rather than strict data type enforcement.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles.
 * - /pedidos/{pedidoId}: Stores material orders placed by users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own user profiles.
 * - Users can only access their own material orders.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to allow rapid prototyping.
 * - All `list` operations are restricted by ownership to prevent unauthorized data enumeration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The "Order" entity includes a "userId" field, which is used to enforce ownership.

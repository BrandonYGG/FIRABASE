/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only read,
 * create, update, and delete their own data. All write operations are
 * authenticated and authorized against the user's ID. Data validation is
 * minimized to allow for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only by the user.
 * - /pedidos/{pedidoId}: Stores material orders, accessible only by the user who created them.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 * - Public read access is not granted to any collection.
 * - The rules explicitly deny any operation that isn't explicitly allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Order` entity includes a `userId` field to enable simple ownership checks without additional reads.

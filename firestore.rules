/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model where users can only access their own data.
 * It prioritizes security by default, restricting access unless explicitly granted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Orders are stored under `/pedidos/{pedidoId}` and must have a `userId` field matching the authenticated user's UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete orders associated with their user ID.
 * - Listing of orders is allowed only for the owner of the order.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Orders include a `userId` field, enabling direct authorization checks without additional reads.

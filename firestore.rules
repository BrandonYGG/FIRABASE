/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @version 2
 *
 * @description
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for both user profiles and material orders.
 * Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profile information, accessible only by the user.
 * - `/pedidos`: Stores material orders, accessible only by the user who created the order.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only list their own orders.
 * - Users cannot list all user profiles.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Orders contain a `userId` field, which is used to authorize access based on the user's ID.

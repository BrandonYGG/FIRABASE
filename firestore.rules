/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure authorization by enforcing a strict user-ownership model for both user profiles and orders.
 * Data shape validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /pedidos: Stores orders placed by users. Each order contains a `userId` field to identify the owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing of all users is disallowed.
 * - Orders are only accessible to their creators.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Order` entity includes a `userId` field, enabling direct ownership checks without additional reads.

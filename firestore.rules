/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the material orders application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is in "prototyping mode" and prioritizes rapid development. It anticipates the future addition of user authentication and role-based access control.
 * Currently, all data is readable and writable, simulating an open sandbox environment.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All material order documents are stored in the top-level `/orders/{orderId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is not applicable in this application.
 * - Assumes public read access for the `/orders` collection.
 * - Does not enforce data validation in "prototyping mode", except for ownership on write operations.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The current ruleset does not require denormalization as it operates in an open sandbox. However, the data structure anticipates future denormalization of user-specific information within order documents to enforce ownership or role-based access control.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Not applicable at this stage.

     * @allow (get, list) All users can read all orders.
     * @allow (create) Authenticated users can create orders.
     * @allow (update, delete) No one can update or delete orders (currently disabled for prototyping).
     * @deny (create) Unauthenticated users cannot create orders.
     * @principle Allows anyone to read orders, but restricts modification to authenticated users.

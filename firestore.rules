/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the 'pedidos' collection.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is in "prototyping mode" which prioritizes rapid development. It currently provides a public read with owner-only writes.
 * When authentication is added, the rules can be modified to restrict access based on user roles or ownership.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All order documents are stored in the top-level `/pedidos` collection. Each document represents a single order.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted for all documents in the `/pedidos` collection.
 * - Owner-only write access is enforced, meaning only the user who created the order can modify or delete it. The `id` field is used as the owner id.
 * - List operations are public.

     * @allow (create) Authenticated user can create a new order document if the `id` field matches their UID.
     * @allow (update, delete) Authenticated user can update or delete an existing order document if the `id` field matches their UID.
     * @deny (create) An unauthenticated user cannot create a new order.
     * @deny (update, delete) An unauthenticated user cannot update or delete an existing order.
     * @deny (create) Authenticated user cannot create a new order if the `id` field does not match their UID.
     * @deny (update, delete) Authenticated user cannot update or delete an existing order if the `id` field does not match the order's `id` field.
     * @principle Enforces public read access and owner-only write access for order documents.

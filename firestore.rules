/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for both user profiles and material orders (pedidos). Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own data.  Listing all orders is disallowed.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /pedidos/{pedidoId}: Stores material orders.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are private and accessible only to the owning user.
 * - Material orders are accessible only to the user who created them.
 * - Listing all orders is explicitly disallowed due to the potential for data exposure.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Each order document contains a `userId` field that is used to enforce ownership. This avoids the need for complex queries or joins to determine authorization.

/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the material order application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is in prototyping mode. It assumes a simple data model with a single 'orders' collection.
 * It does not enforce strict schema validation to allow for rapid iteration. It implements authentication checks and assumes eventual role-based access control.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All order data is stored in the top-level `/orders/{orderId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - **No Public Listing:** The `orders` collection does not allow public listing (`list` operation).
 * - **Authentication Required for Write:** Authentication is required to create, update or delete.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - In the future, when authentication is implemented, user roles can be stored in a separate collection (`roles_admin`) and checked in the rules using `exists()` to determine authorization.

     * @allow (update) Only signed in users can update.
     * @allow (delete) Only signed in users can delete.
     * @deny (list) No one can list orders.
     * @principle Disallows listing. Allows getting, creating, updating, and deleting of orders only for autheticated users.

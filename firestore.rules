/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes strict authorization based on user identity and ownership,
 * while adopting a flexible approach to data validation for rapid prototyping.
 * It enforces that users can only access their own data, with explicit denials for
 * unauthorized access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`, accessible only to the
 *   corresponding user.
 * - Orders are stored under `/pedidos/{pedidoId}` and are accessible only to the user
 *   who created them. The `userId` field within each `Order` document is used for
 *   ownership validation.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing of all users is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Data validation is relaxed during prototyping, focusing solely on
 *   authorization-critical fields.
 * - Destructive operations (update, delete) are only permitted if the document exists
 *   and the user is the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Order` entity MUST contain a `userId` field that matches the authenticated
 *   user's UID to enforce ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - The data model uses distinct collections for user profiles and orders, each with
 *   specific access rules to maintain data privacy and integrity.

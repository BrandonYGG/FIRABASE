    "reasoning": "Given the requirement for a front-end only application (no backend, direct Firestore access), and the focus on order management for a construction company, the simplest and most direct approach is to store orders in a single collection.  Since the application explicitly states the intent to add authentication later, we structure the database anticipating user-specific data.  This design anticipates the addition of user authentication, even though it's not immediately implemented. This supports future scalability and security when authentication is integrated.\n\n**Authorization Independence (Future):** Currently, all data will be readable/writable in \"sandbox\" mode, but when authentication is added, the structure allows for simple role-based access control or ownership based on user ID by changing the security rules.\n\n**QAPs:**\n*   The segregation of all orders into a single `/orders` collection ensures a uniform security posture.  Initially open, future security rules can be applied to all documents within the collection.\n\nFuture improvements:\n\n*   Adding user authentication and segmenting orders by user, e.g., `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}`.\n*   Implementing proper security rules based on authentication and user roles.\n*   Consider using subcollections for related data like order history or delivery logs, if the complexity increases."
